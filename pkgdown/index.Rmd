> __embrs__ is in development

__embrs__ was initially written as part of work on a scoping exercise to provide 
early estimates of the environmental impacts of the diesel to electric bus 
transition published as [Tivey et al 2023](https://doi.org/10.3390/su15021522)

## code sources

__embrs__ code sources: https://github.com/karlropkins/embrs


## Installation

You can install the development version of embrs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("karlropkins/embrs")
```

## Example

__embrs__ uses vehicle and route objects to build emission models in the classic form: 

> [emissions] * [activity] 

For example: 

```{r example1, fig.height=4}
library(embrs)
# a EURO VI ICE diesel bus weighing 15925 kg
bus.1 <- bus_ice(name="E6DV", veh.wt=15925, euro.class="vi", eng.fuel="diesel") 
# an 30 km/hr route
route.30 <- route_veh_spd(30)
# multiple them 
mod <- bus.1 * route.30
# plot that
plot(mod)
```

Vehicles can also be added together to make fleets and these and routes can 
be multiplied to produce small-scale emission inventories or compare emissions 
on different routes.

For example:

```{r example2}
# EURO VI diesel versus Battery Electric BUS comparison from Tivey et al (2023)
# a EURO VI ICE diesel bus weighing 15925 kg
bus.1 <- bus_ice(name="E6DV", veh.wt=15925, euro.class="VI", eng.fuel="diesel") 
# a battery electric bus weighing 17725 kg (and conventional brakes) 
bus.2 <- bus_bev(name="BEV", veh.wt=17725) 
# like bus.2 but with regenerative brakes operating at 25% efficiency
bus.3 <- bus_bev(name="BEV\nlow", veh.wt=17725, brk.regen = 0.25) 
# like bus.3 but 75% efficiency
bus.4 <- bus_bev(name="BEV\nhi", veh.wt=17725, brk.regen = 0.75)  
# a small fleet
fleet <- bus.1 + bus.2 + bus.3 + bus.4
# some routes 
routes <- route_naei_urban() + route_naei_rural() + route_naei_motorway()
# an inventory
inventory <- fleet * routes
# just plotting PM contributions by vehicle (bus.1 to 4)
plot(inventory, plot.type="by.vehicle", em.type="just.pm")
```
