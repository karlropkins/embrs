Average speed curves are based on European Environment Agency 2019 EMEP/EEA
methods as documented in:

European Environment Agency, 2019. EMEP/EEA air pollutant
emission inventory guidebook.

\arguments{
\item{veh.spd}{average vehicle speed, in km/h.}

\item{veh.type}{vehicle type, currently only coded for urban buses, see Note.}

\item{veh.wt}{vehicle weight, in km.}

\item{em.type}{type of emission, currently PM, PM2.5 or PM10, see Note.}

\item{em.source}{emission source: currently, exhaust only.}

\item{euro.class}{EURO classification: PRE, I, II, III, IV, V,
V or VI only.}

\item{exh.tech}{exhaust technology: for euro.class IV SCR or EGR,
for V  SCR or EGR, and for VI DPF+SCR only}

\item{eng.load}{engine load, as proportion: 0. 0.5 or 1 only.}

\item{route.slope}{route slope, as proportion: -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0,
0.02, 0.04 or 0.06 only.}

\description{
Functions to calculate vehicle speed-based hot exhaust
PM2.5 and PM10 emission factors based on EEA guidelines 2019 methods.
}
\note{
The embrs::ef_eea2019 functions are currently only coded for urban
buses, \code{veh.type="bus"}.

Strictly, EEA 2019 PM exhaust emission factors are PM, but because
vehicle exhaust PM is fine it is typically assumed that:

PM10 = PM2.5 = PM for exhaust emissions from most conventional diesel and
gasoline vehicles.

Fuel Corrections are applied to account for improvements in emissions
associated with improvements in fuel quality,
